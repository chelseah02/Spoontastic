## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I think I have successfully completed routing of the pages, so clicking on a recipe leads to its unique page. However, the representation of the details data is still presenting challenges to me as well as the generation of a graphic as of Monday 4/3/2023 9:45pm PT.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
I have not been able to successfully implement search functionality and another filter at this time. I also ran out renders (free queries enabled by the Spoonacular API)
for 2 accounts today. Stay tuned for Wednesday night when I complete the rest of the functionality for this app. (AS OF MONDAY 3/27/2023 9:26PM PT)

AS OF WEDNESDAY 3/29/2023 4:26PM
All required functionality is complete! I used search bars for filtering the fetched data by name and servings. Servings can also be filtered by button to diversify the input data type.
